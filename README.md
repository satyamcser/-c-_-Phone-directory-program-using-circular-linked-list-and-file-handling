# -C++-Phone-directory-program-using-circular-linked-list-and-file-handling
Name of project: Telephone directory program 

Purpose: Create a simple program using a circular linked list to simulate a telephone directory.

Evaluate result:
We got successful implementation of program using given data structure. Despite
there being some compilation issues, we made it work after multiple modifications in
the code and adding some relevant libraries for different Operating systems. For
example, in linux, we don’t have <conio.h>, so we have to use <curses.h> and while
implementing on command line have to implement it using
g++ dsa.cpp -lncurses -o dsa and therefore it got compiled and we got perfect results
as expected.

Conclusion:
A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are
also connected to each other to form a circle. So implementing it for the telephone
directory wasn’t that easy, but after hard teamwork and multiple testing of our code,
we were successful in generating the result we expected. We tested our program on
multiple OS such as android, MacOS, Windows, Linux etc and it ran on all OS successfully. 
Hence, we got a successful solution to the given task/problem. Overall,
we learned a lot while completing this project successfully.
